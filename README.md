# My Personal Health Record

## About

There are many persons with chronic illnesses, sometimes even multiple chronic illnesses. Each of these patients know that it is crucial for them to manage their conditions by supplying their health care providers with important data. Data, such as vital signs, weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, diet, exercise, etc. can help a patient and their provider better refine their treatment plan and goals. This website aims to give the patient a place to input the large amounts of data and securely store it to be able to retreive it when necessary.
