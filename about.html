                            <p>This project idea was developed out of a personal necessity. As an individual who has multiple chronic illnesses, I find it an extreme displeasure trying to manage my health. There is so much data that is generated on a daily basis that it is difficult to keep up with. Worse is the method in which your healthcare providers expect you to keep up with it. Record it on a paper form. Even though many providers may require the same information (e.g. blood glucose or blood pressure) they each have their own forms. Even if the possibility of a digital app is available, no two providers use the same app or share data with each other, even in the same healthcare system.</p>
                            <p>My project aims to help bring multiple areas of chronic illnesses into one application. In doing this, I hope to simplify how a patient can manage their data. From Appointments to Prescriptions, everything will be in one application. The user will have the option to enter their information and save it. The forms are intuitive and simple to use. The application can generate reports, charts and graphs as well as simple things like calendars or contact list.</p>
