                            <p>The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other individually identifiable health information (collectively defined as “protected health information”) and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically. The Rule requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such information without an individual’s authorization. The Rule also gives individuals rights over their protected health information, including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records, to direct a covered entity to transmit to a third party an electronic copy of their protected health information in an electronic health record, and to request corrections.</p>
                            <p>The Privacy Rule is located at 45 CFR <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-160?toc=1">Part 160</a> and Subparts A and E of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-164">Part 164</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>You have the right to restrict how your protected health information is used and disclosed for treatment, payment or healthcare operations. We are not required to agree with this restriction, but if we do, we shall honor this agreement. The HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) law allows for the use of the information for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.</p>

                            <h6>Right to Records</h6>
                            <p>You have the right to view any part of or all of your medical record. You cannot be refused access to your health information because you have unpaid balances to your account.</p>

                            <h6>Right to Share With A Third Party</h6>
                            <p>You have the right to share your medical records with any third party you chose. You can do this on your own or request that we do it for you. If you request that we do it for you, you must sign an acknowledgement and waiver for us to do so. You should be aware that once your information is transmitted to a third party (either by your or by us), we are no longer responsible for the security of that information after it is sent. For example, if we transmit your labwork results to a specialist, we are not responsible to ensure that the specialist maintains your privacy. We are still required to maintain your privacy on our end.</p>
